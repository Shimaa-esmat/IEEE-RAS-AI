Conditional Probability
**********************
-It is consider dependent Probability
-It is expressed like this (frist|second) 
-It is contain dependent and independent events
-first event is dependent but second independent oon first one
-calculating the probability of secand event p(S)
   sum of its probability in all probabilities in firest one

Summary:
********
p(S) = [p(S|F1)*p(F)]+[p(S|F2)*p(F)]


Conditional Probability is different from Binomial distribution
  second event in Conditional Probability dependent on firest event 
  Binomial distribution secont event only dependent on its probability no matter how firest event was
