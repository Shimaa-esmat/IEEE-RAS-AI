Neural Network
  algorithms that try to mimic the human brain
   The larger the size of the neurons and the input data, the higher the performance

 *logistic regression algorithm can be avery simplified model of signle neuron
*layer one or group of neurons take similar input and return output(input &hidden layer)
 
neural networks work
 feature in input layer acces hidden layer which contain many logistic algorithms which do orders -> (activation vectors) then return outbut
 activation vector output from previous layer and input to next one

Inference applies knowledge from a trained neural network model and a uses it to infer a result
forward propagation :doing operation  from left to right

TensorFlow
  TensorFlow platform helps to implement best practices for data, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining
