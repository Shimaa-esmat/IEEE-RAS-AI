Binomial distribution
**********************
-binomial distribution is probability distribution that gives only two possible results 
-number of possiable way that one probability could be
   n!/(k!*(n-k)) --> n num of times repeated & k = num one of  probabilities appear
-p(x) = n!/(k!*(n-k)) * p^k(1-p)^(n-k)

Summary:
*******
we perform Binomial distribution with events have two outcomes
using it to know if:
-customer buy or not
-transaction fraud or not
-coin flip is head or tail
